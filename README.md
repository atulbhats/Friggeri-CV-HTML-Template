# Friggeri CV HTML Template
 
 HTML CV Template inspired by Friggeri CV, built on same design using bootstrap.
 
 Seeing so many LaTeX modifications and application of the Friggeri CV template, I wanted to create one using HTML. 
 So here it is. Created for fun. If you can use it, then I'm glad I build this.
 
 **Usage**:
 Download the html file and copy the entity boxes as per requirements. 
 Edit the necessary info. 
 Print or Save as HTML.
