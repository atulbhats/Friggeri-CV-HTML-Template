# Friggeri CV HTML Template
 
 HTML CV Template inspired by Friggeri CV, built on same design using bootstrap.
 
 Seeing so many LaTeX modifications and application of the Friggeri CV template, I wanted to create one using HTML. 
 So here it is. Created for fun. If you can use it, then I'm glad I build this.
 
 ##Usage:
 -Download the html file and copy the entity boxes as per requirements. 
 -Edit the necessary info.
 -Manage page breaks.  
 -Print or Save as HTML.
